## Overview

This project is centered around **image cartoonization**, leveraging computer vision techniques to create a stylized version of an input image. The application includes:

- A simple GUI built with **Tkinter**
- Integration of **OpenCV** for image processing
- Functionality to display and save results in a few clicks

## Features

- Upload and preview any image
- Convert photos into cartoon-style drawings
- Compare original vs cartoonified side by side
- Save the processed image locally
- Intuitive and clean GUI

**Programming Language:** Python  
**IDE:** Visual Studio Code

**Libraries:**
- `opencv-python`: for image processing
- `numpy`: for numerical operations
- `imageio`: to handle image file I/O
- `matplotlib`: to display image comparisons
- `easygui`: for simple file selection dialogs
- `Pillow`: to handle image formats
- `tkinter`: for GUI development
